			<p>Hello! My name is Arthur Crovetto. I am 20 years od and I originally come from Monaco but I have been studying at ESSEC Business School for the last 3 years in the BBA program. I'm passionate about <strong>photography</strong> and <strong>art</strong>, but I also love <strong>travelling</strong> and discovering new cultures.</p>

			<h2>Photography</h2>
			<p>Since I was a kid, I have always enjoyed going to museums and taking photos. I'm not saying I am the best photographer but I enjoy capturing special moments with my camera (which is most often my phone) to have them for ever. Below, you can find a link to my VSCO profile, where I often posts some pictures I take.</p>

			<h3>Art</h3>
			<p>One of my favorite hobbies is visiting museums and spending hours wandering through the corridors and exhibition rooms. My favorite museum of all time is the Louvre in Paris, and in close second, the Louisiana Museum in Copenhagen. My favorite artist right now would probably be <strong><a href="https://jamesturrell.com/" target="_blank" class="link-none"> James Turrell</a></strong>.</p>

			<h4>Travelling the World</h4>
			<p>Throughout my life, I have had the chance to visit amazing places all over the world. These include New York City, Barbados, Norway. What I am most appreciative of were my two exchange semesters in Copenhagen, Denmark, and in Singapore. I fell in love with Copenhagen even if I stayed there only 3 months and I really want to live there later.</p>
